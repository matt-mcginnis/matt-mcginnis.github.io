# Personal Static Webpage (Matt McGinnis)

## Actual Webpage
You can check out the actual webpage [here](https://matt-mcginnis.github.io/). It is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which is an excellent way to get a minimal static site up and running.

## Getting Started
If you would like to use this static site as a template for your own project, all you need to do is clone the repository and start tinkering.

To view changes to the site locally, simply open up the **index.html** with the browser of your choice.

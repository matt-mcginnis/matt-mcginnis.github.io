									<h2>My Story</h2>
									<p>Family has always been the most important part of my life. From left to right we have my younger sister (Molly) followed by my parents (Anna and Terry) and finally me, my wife (Brooke) and the newest addition to the family (Elizabeth).</p>

									<h2>Technology</h2>
									<p>Professionally, I am an Associate Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.travelers.com/">Travelers</a>. On a day to day basis I usually work with languages in the .NET Framework (VB.NET, C#) as well as Microsoft SQL Server. Occassionally, my team does some development on a more modern Vue application, which involves some work in Javascript and HTML. At the moment we are making a shift towards cloud computing. So I am gaining experience with the AWS stack.</p>
									<p>In my free time my language of choice is <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. I have a deep interest in Machine Learning and Data Analysis and have been trying to broaden my skillset and experience with related Python modules (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, etc.) I also enjoy configuring my personal development environment and do a lot of work updating configuration files for technologies I like using (<a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Zsh</a>,  Konsole, etc.)</p>

									<h2>Fun</h2>
									<p>I enjoy any opportunity to get outside and move around on a nice day! Some of my favorite outdoor activities include pickleball, skateboarding, bike riding and various yard games. After work and on weekends my wife and I spend as much time as we can playing with our daughter, Elizabeth. When we have the time, we will occasionally binge the latest series of interest on one of the streaming platforms we are subscribed to. If I am really looking for something to do, I can be caught tinkering with my computer or exploring <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a> problems.</p>

									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>I think Python is such a fun language! Even though it is not part of the stack I use for the work I do at Travelers, I try to learn a little bit more about it everyday.</p>

									<span class="icon solid major fa-database"></span>
									<h3>SQL</h3>
									<p>During my time at Farragut Systems I gained a ton of experience with Oracle SQL and Microsoft SQL Server. I continue using my knowledge of SQL almost everyday at work and take every opportunity I get to try to optimize any queries I come across.</p>

									<h3>Customization and Configuration</h3>
									<p>I love finding and learning about different Linux distributions as well as text editor and various plugins for them. Recently I have been jumping back and forth between Manjaro and openSUSE. My editor of choice is Neovim and you can find some of my configurations on my <a href="https://github.com/matt-mcginnis">Github</a>.</p>

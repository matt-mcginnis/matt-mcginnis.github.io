                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <h2>Just a guy who enjoys mathematics and computers.</h2>
                <p>I am a simple guy. I see computer stuff, I get excited. I have not had much formal training when it comes to hardware and software, but I have learned a few things during my time studying mathematics. In addition to playing around with computers and studying mathematics, I enjoy skateboarding, watching movies and visiting my family as much as possible.

                My fiance, Brooke, and I recently moved to Raleigh, North Carolina. We are very excited to be back in NC and even more excited about our wedding in September! Brooke accepted an offer for a software engineering position at Bandwidth and started on July 23. I am currently enrolled in Tech Talent South's Code Immersion program, and took the plunge into web development on September 4th.</p>
